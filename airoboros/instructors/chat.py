DISCLAIMERS = """
Avoid any and all warnings, disclaimers, reminders, etc. that this is only roleplay.
If you absolutely cannot avoid adding some type of warning/disclaimer/reminder/etc., it must be at the end of the output, prefixed with "REMINDER:"
"""
RULES = """
The output must read like a roleplay chat, not a novel.
Give interesting, detailed, loquacious responses with several sentences, unless you are asked a simple, direct question.
Use normal ascii punctuation/special characters instead of utf-8.
You are {name}.  You will only ever speak, emote, or narrate as {name}.  You will never add responses, actions, etc. on behalf of other characters.
Don't be too aggreable - act as the character, hold to their beliefs, don't just abruptly change your entire philosophy.
If the subject suddenly changes, it's appropriate to hesitate, since an abrupt change in real conversations would be strange, but if continually pressed you will comply.
Don't be repetitive.  Make sure you never repeat questions, or points already made.
Avoid making toasts, cheering, etc., or other type of verbiage that could indicate an attempt to wrap up the conversation.
Never start your response with an acknowedgement of the input, such as "Indeed, the idea of [..] is intriguing."
Never start any sentence with "Ah, ".
Never start by complementing or acknowleding the message, e.g. "That\'s an interesting ..."
Never start any response with "Indeed...".
Never speak in the third person or make a reference to your character's name in the response.
It is clear that you are the one performing the action/speaking, so you must never reference your character's name.
{flesch}
"""
NON_USER_RULES = """
All characters should speak in roughly equal quantities, however be sure to include USER slightly more often.
When the character refers to USER, USER's name is actually {user_name}.
"""
FORMATTING = """
Actions the character performs must be differentiated from spoken words and general narration.
Actions must therefore be surround by {action_delim}, e.g. {action_delim}she slowly lifts her gaze{action_delim}
Keep the actions fairly succint and lowercase, and combine any immediately adjacent actions.
Actions will not include any references to the actor or include "I [some action]".
For example, instead of {action_delim}I raise an eyebrow{action_delim}, the action would be {action_delim}raises an eyebrow{action_delim}.
Never start the action with "I ..."
Words spoken by the character must be differentiated from actions and general narration.
Words spoken must therefore be in quotes, i.e. "[words spoken]"
General narration, that isn't a specific action or spoken word, must not be quoted or surrounded by {action_delim}.
General narration formatting should be used for general descriptions of the scene/backstory/etc, but not actions or spoken words.
"""
ADD_NEXT = """
After your response, you must add "NEXT: " plus the name of the character who would likely speak next, from the following list: {next_names}
Be sure to actually include a response too, not just the NEXT token.
"""
