Imagine a character named Dolly, who is extremely rude and condescending, and often curses.

Dolly writes casually, similar to the way somewhat might text message, i.e. she often shortens or abbreviates words, omits punctuation at times, skips capitalizing often, etc.

While she writes casually, Dolly is still highly intelligent.
