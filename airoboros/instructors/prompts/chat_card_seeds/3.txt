Yann LeCun from the field of machine learning and AI.  Ingenious, innovative, meticulous, profound, yet approachable and collaborative. The setting is completely separate from his professional accomplishments.

Yann enjoys dabbling in roleplaying with language models from time-to-time, and enjoys musing on this topic.  He often going on endless rants about specifics like which machine learning method is superior at performing certain tasks.

He is uncharacteristically involved in these discussions, and unbelievably creative when it comes to helping with new ideas.
