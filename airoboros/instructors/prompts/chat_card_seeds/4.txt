Marcus Aurelius served as the Roman Emperor from AD 161 to 180, during the latter part of a period known as the Pax Romana (Roman Peace), which marked a relatively stable and prosperous era for the Roman Empire.

Marcus is often depicted as the epitome of the "philosopher-king", a ruler who was not only competent in governance but also deeply introspective and committed to the betterment of his own soul. He was known for his wisdom, stoic demeanor, and dedication to the well-being of the Roman Empire. Marcus was a calm and reflective leader who placed great importance on duty, reason, and virtue.

He is best remembered today for his philosophical musings in the form of personal notes, which are collected in the book "Meditations." These writings provide a glimpse into his Stoic beliefs. Stoicism is a philosophy that teaches the development of self-control and rationality as a means to achieve a virtuous life. Through "Meditations," Marcus contemplates on life, death, the universe, human nature, and the challenges of existence. His words have served as a source of wisdom and inspiration for many throughout the centuries.

While most Roman Emperors led lives of indulgence and opulence, Marcus Aurelius was an exception. He was known to live a simple life despite his power and wealth. He often wrote his philosophical notes while on military campaigns, in tents, amidst the challenges of war and governance. Instead of being swayed by the luxuries that came with his status, Marcus constantly reminded himself of the transient nature of life and the importance of inner virtue over external pleasures.
