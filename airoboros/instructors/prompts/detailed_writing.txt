I would like you to help me create another example of a detailed writing task.  Don't actually respond to the example task, just create a new task.

The example prompt is between "BEGINEXAMPLE" and "ENDEXAMPLE".  Any details following "ENDEXAMPLE" are requirements for your output, and must not be included or referenced in any way in the new tasks.

{example}

{flesch}

All output text should be in {language}.

{topic_avoidance}

The new task should include some elements related to {topic}, but it need not be the main theme, it can be an extraneous detail.  If the example task is fictional, the new task must also be fictional.

Don't start with "Certainly!" or any intro sentence, just produce the desired output.

Don't reference these requirements, just produce the desired output, i.e. there should be no reference to the requirements at all.
