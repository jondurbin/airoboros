# What are Lightweight Models?

NOTE: This is the explanation section, so this is more around explaining the architecture and 
why things are designed the way they are. This is normally text and diagrams, not code.

TODO: STUB

Models are created by optimising existing models, such as llama-2. 
These smaller models can perform as well as much larger models, yet have 
far lower hardware requirements.
This approach was inspired by the LoRA paper {!docs/includes/papers/lora.md!}.
